This article is just quick recap of majority of cases in which boxing occurs in C#6.0 or higher.
Boxing occurs everywhere when we need a reference type to a value type. Here is the most popular example:

<div class="code">
<span class="ValueType">int</span>&nbsp;number&nbsp;=&nbsp;123;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<span class="ReferenceType">object</span>&nbsp;boxed&nbsp;=&nbsp;number;
</div>

But what about another cases that are not so obvious? Letâ€™s consider them.
